# Long-context comparison against llama.cpp

Same box, same NVFP4 weights, same prompt, same harness (`bench/longctx/ttft.py`),
runs sequential so neither contender has the GPU to itself. llama.cpp is
`tools/llama.cpp/build/bin/llama-server` on `models/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4.gguf` with
`-fa on -np 1`; gb10-server is this repo's build.

Two definitions, because "TTFT" hides a real question:

* **cold TTFT** — the prefix has never been seen, so the whole prompt is prefilled.
* **warm TTFT** — the identical request again, so a prefix cache can skip the prefill.

The prompt is repeated filler plus "list the integers 1 to 300", which stops the
model answering in two tokens and makes OTPS an average over ~198 intervals.

## 8K — with the new decode kernel

| metric | gb10-server | llama.cpp | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| prompt tokens | 8,225 | 8,263 | — |
| **cold TTFT** | **88.9 s** | **10.45 s** | 8.5× slower |
| **warm TTFT** | **0.035 s** | **0.24 s** | **6.9× faster** |
| **OTPS** | **2.34** | **7.43** | 3.2× slower |

## 32K

| metric | gb10-server | llama.cpp | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| prompt tokens | 32,747 | 32,785 | — |
| **cold TTFT** | **821.0 s** | **44.3 s** | 18.5× slower |
| **warm TTFT** | **0.05 s** | **0.27 s** | **5.4× faster** |
| **OTPS** | **3.13** | **7.0** | 2.2× slower |

llama.cpp's 32K numbers are the mean of three trials (43.55 / 44.85 / 44.46
cold, 0.29 / 0.28 / 0.25 warm). gb10's cold TTFT is unchanged by the prefix
cache, which is the point of it: a cold request has nothing to resume from.

**Warm TTFT is won.** It was 821 s at 32K — byte-identical to cold, because the
server wiped its own cache every request — and is now 0.05 s, faster than
llama.cpp's 0.27 s. At 8K it is 0.035 s against 0.24 s. The two numbers below
are what the two mechanisms bought, separately.

## The prefix cache

`run_group` used to start with `state.reset(dev)`, which zeroed every KV cache,
conv history and recurrence on **every** request. There was no warm path at all.

The interesting part is that a position counter is not enough to rewind: the 48
Gated-DeltaNet layers carry a *recurrence*, and the state after N-1 tokens
cannot be recovered from the state after N by moving an offset. So the cache
snapshots the recurrence (`ModelState::snapshot_recurrent`, which already
existed for the MTP verify path) and restores it.

A snapshot is taken **after** each prompt rather than one token short of it, and
the token that prompt prefilled to is cached beside it. An exact repeat
therefore runs no forward pass at all: restore, hand back the cached token, and
let the decode loop continue from a state that is already exactly where it
should be. That is why warm TTFT is 35 ms and not ~250 ms — it is the cost of a
160 MB device-to-device copy, not of a forward pass.

Correctness of that is not assumed. `bench/longctx/prefix_ab.sh` runs one
request sequence — a repeat, an unrelated prompt after a cached one, and a
prefix extension — against a caching server and against one started with
`--no-prefix-cache`, and requires the output to be identical. It is wired into
`loop/run_round.sh` as its own gate, because none of the `gb10-verify` gates go
through the server's resume path and so none of them test it.

One limitation, deliberate: a miss costs the whole group its cache, since
`reset` and the snapshot are both whole-state operations. Mixed groups fall back
to a full prefill. This can make a group slower, never wrong.

## What the new decode kernel bought

`attn_decode_multi_kernel` used to give every thread one `head_dim` lane and walk
the keys serially, calling `block_reduce_sum` once per key — two
`__syncthreads()` inside the loop, so the block advanced exactly one key per
barrier and no two keys were ever in flight. It now gives each *warp* a strided
subset of the keys, reduces a key's score with `__shfl_xor` inside the warp, and
merges the eight warps' partials once.

`gb10-verify decode-bench` times both, in the same binary, so this is an A/B and
not a comparison across builds:

| keys | serial | warp | speedup | rms rel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2,048 | 2.405 ms | 0.399 ms | 6.02× | 1.18e-6 |
| 8,192 | 9.629 ms | 1.579 ms | 6.10× | 2.07e-6 |
| 32,768 | 37.831 ms | 6.452 ms | 5.86× | 4.31e-6 |
| 65,536 | 74.216 ms | 12.514 ms | 5.93× | 6.36e-6 |

RMS-relative because a per-element relative error is meaningless on values that
cross zero. Agreement is ~1e-6; a tiling or indexing bug would show up at O(1).
End to end, at 8K with everything else held constant, **OTPS goes 1.82 → 2.41
(+32%)**. Correctness is unchanged: `generate` is still 16/16 token-exact against
the bf16 oracle and identical across 8 repeats.

The 6× does not become 6× end to end because attention is not where decode
spends its time. Working back from the measured numbers at 8K:

* all 21.9 GB of weights, streamed once per token at the measured 228 GB/s, is
  **96 ms** — a hard floor of ~10.4 tok/s;
* attention, at the warp kernel's 1.58 ms per layer × 16, is **~25 ms**;
* measured is ~430 ms/token.

So most of the decode step is neither weights-at-peak nor attention, and that is
why OTPS is 3.2× off rather than 6×. Note also that the server decodes a single
request through a 24-block grid — one block per query head — on a GPU with 48
SMs, so the decode kernels are running at half occupancy before anything else is
considered. Sizing that grid to the work is the next thing to look at.

## Cold TTFT

Prefill cost is `≈5.11 ms·T + 5.93e-7·T²`, so the 8.5× at 8K and 18.5× at 32K
are both dominated by kernels that are behind llama.cpp's, in the projections as
well as in attention: short-context prefill runs at ~7.2 TFLOPS against
llama.cpp's ~40. The tiled attention kernel is the other half, and it still
reads K/V once per query head and keeps the cache in f32.
