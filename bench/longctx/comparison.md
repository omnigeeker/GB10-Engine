# Long-context comparison against llama.cpp

Same box, same NVFP4 weights, same prompt, same harness (`bench/longctx/ttft.py`),
runs sequential so neither contender has the GPU to itself. llama.cpp is
`tools/llama.cpp/build/bin/llama-server` on `models/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4.gguf` with
`-fa on -np 1`; gb10-server is this repo's build.

Two definitions, because "TTFT" hides a real question:

* **cold TTFT** — the prefix has never been seen, so the whole prompt is prefilled.
* **warm TTFT** — the identical request again, so a prefix cache can skip the prefill.

The prompt is repeated filler plus "list the integers 1 to 300", which stops the
model answering in two tokens and makes OTPS an average over ~198 intervals.

## 8K — with the new decode kernel

| metric | gb10-server | llama.cpp | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| prompt tokens | 8,225 | 8,263 | — |
| **cold TTFT** | **88.3 s** | **10.45 s** | 8.4× slower |
| **warm TTFT** | **0.035 s** | **0.24 s** | **6.9× faster** |
| **OTPS** | **5.94** | **7.43** | 1.25× slower |

## 32K

| metric | gb10-server | llama.cpp | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| prompt tokens | 32,747 | 32,785 | — |
| **cold TTFT** | **822.1 s** | **44.3 s** | 18.6× slower |
| **warm TTFT** | **0.05 s** | **0.27 s** | **5.4× faster** |
| **OTPS** | **4.43** | **7.0** | 1.58× slower |

llama.cpp's 32K numbers are the mean of three trials (43.55 / 44.85 / 44.46
cold, 0.29 / 0.28 / 0.25 warm). gb10's cold TTFT is unchanged by the prefix
cache, which is the point of it: a cold request has nothing to resume from.

**Warm TTFT is won.** It was 821 s at 32K — byte-identical to cold, because the
server wiped its own cache every request — and is now 0.05 s, faster than
llama.cpp's 0.27 s. At 8K it is 0.035 s against 0.24 s.

## The batch-size bug

`step_batch` returned `memcpy_dtov(&state.idx)` unchanged, and `state.idx` is
`state.n_seq` entries long — not the `n_seq` the caller actually passed in. The
server's decode loop feeds that result straight back in as the next step's
tokens, so a group of 1 was promoted to a group of `state.n_seq` on its second
step and stayed there.

The answers were unaffected, because the extra slots are idle and nothing reads
them, which is exactly why it survived: `batch-parity` passes 16 real sequences,
so it always exercised the correct path. What it broke was the cost.

`GB10_STEP_TIMING=1` prints the split, and it is unambiguous:

| | submit | drain | total | slots |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| before | 100.4 ms | 324.5 ms | 424.8 ms | 16 |
| after | 33.2 ms | 106.3 ms | 139.6 ms | 1 |

A lone request was doing **16× the work**, which is why its per-token cost was
flat against both context length and batch size, and why starting the server
with a larger `--concurrency` made OTPS *worse* (16 slots at 8K measured 2.34
tok/s, 8 slots at 32K measured 3.13). After the fix the drain is 106 ms against
the 94.8 ms that `gb10-bench stream` measures for streaming all the weights at
185 GB/s — the decode step is now within 12% of its bandwidth roofline.

## The prefix cache

`run_group` used to start with `state.reset(dev)`, which zeroed every KV cache,
conv history and recurrence on **every** request. There was no warm path at all.

The interesting part is that a position counter is not enough to rewind: the 48
Gated-DeltaNet layers carry a *recurrence*, and the state after N-1 tokens
cannot be recovered from the state after N by moving an offset. So the cache
snapshots the recurrence (`ModelState::snapshot_recurrent`, which already
existed for the MTP verify path) and restores it.

A snapshot is taken **after** each prompt rather than one token short of it, and
the token that prompt prefilled to is cached beside it. An exact repeat
therefore runs no forward pass at all: restore, hand back the cached token, and
let the decode loop continue from a state that is already exactly where it
should be. That is why warm TTFT is 35 ms and not ~250 ms — it is the cost of a
160 MB device-to-device copy, not of a forward pass.

Correctness of that is not assumed. `bench/longctx/prefix_ab.sh` runs one
request sequence — a repeat, an unrelated prompt after a cached one, and a
prefix extension — against a caching server and against one started with
`--no-prefix-cache`, and requires the output to be identical. It is wired into
`loop/run_round.sh` as its own gate, because none of the `gb10-verify` gates go
through the server's resume path and so none of them test it.

One limitation, deliberate: a miss costs the whole group its cache, since
`reset` and the snapshot are both whole-state operations. Mixed groups fall back
to a full prefill. This can make a group slower, never wrong.

## What the new decode kernel bought

`attn_decode_multi_kernel` used to give every thread one `head_dim` lane and walk
the keys serially, calling `block_reduce_sum` once per key — two
`__syncthreads()` inside the loop, so the block advanced exactly one key per
barrier and no two keys were ever in flight. It now gives each *warp* a strided
subset of the keys, reduces a key's score with `__shfl_xor` inside the warp, and
merges the eight warps' partials once.

`gb10-verify decode-bench` times both, in the same binary, so this is an A/B and
not a comparison across builds:

| keys | serial | warp | speedup | rms rel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2,048 | 2.405 ms | 0.399 ms | 6.02× | 1.18e-6 |
| 8,192 | 9.629 ms | 1.579 ms | 6.10× | 2.07e-6 |
| 32,768 | 37.831 ms | 6.452 ms | 5.86× | 4.31e-6 |
| 65,536 | 74.216 ms | 12.514 ms | 5.93× | 6.36e-6 |

RMS-relative because a per-element relative error is meaningless on values that
cross zero. Agreement is ~1e-6; a tiling or indexing bug would show up at O(1).
End to end, at 8K with everything else held constant, **OTPS goes 1.82 → 2.41
(+32%)**. Correctness is unchanged: `generate` is still 16/16 token-exact against
the bf16 oracle and identical across 8 repeats.

The 6× does not become 6× end to end because attention is not where decode
spends its time. Working back from the measured numbers at 8K:

* all 21.9 GB of weights, streamed once per token at the measured 228 GB/s, is
  **96 ms** — a hard floor of ~10.4 tok/s;
* attention, at the warp kernel's 1.17 ms per layer × 16, is **~19 ms**;
* `gb10-bench stream` measures the whole weight set streaming in **94.8 ms at
  185 GB/s (81% of peak)**;
* after the batch-size fix the full step is **140 ms**, of which 106 ms is
  device drain — within 12% of that streaming floor.

So at 8K the decode step is essentially at its bandwidth roofline, and the
remaining 45 ms is the non-GEMM kernels plus host submission. At 32K attention
is no longer negligible — 4.88 ms per layer × 16 = **78 ms** of a 226 ms step —
and that is where OTPS's remaining 1.58× lives.

## Cold TTFT

Prefill cost is `≈5.11 ms·T + 5.93e-7·T²`. The quadratic term is not attention
*arithmetic* — it is attention *traffic*. The tiled kernel runs one block per
query head, so all 24 query heads independently stream the same K/V, and the
cache is f32:

* at 8K the quadratic term is 40 s of the 88 s total;
* at 32K it is 636 s of 822 s.

Against a 6× GQA redundancy (24 query heads over 4 KV heads) and 2× from f32,
the same K/V is being read about 12× more than it needs to be. llama.cpp sits at
~40 TFLOPS on prefill against gb10's ~7, and no amount of fp32 CUDA-core
tuning can close that: `gemm.cu` uses no tensor cores at all — no `mma.sync`, no
`wgmma`, no `__hfma2`, just scalar `fmaf`. Reaching llama.cpp's prefill rate
means bf16 or tf32 tensor cores, which is a numerical change, not just a
scheduling one.
